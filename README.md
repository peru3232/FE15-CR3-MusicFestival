# FE15-CR3-Peter

This project consists of a landing page with contact section and a reviews page. HTML with bootstrap, SCSS, and JS (only for console.log) were used.

To view the pages simply clone this repo then open index.html in your browser.

This project was done as a solution to a end of the week project during my fullstack course at code factory.

Please view the assignment.pdf to view the expected results.

Cheers!
